  <h2>I have an interest in graphic design, and while they can be fairly different, I see some similarities between the two. On my end, there is a desire to provide an aesthetic experience for the user through design, which can be comparable across fields. There are also a few courses I have taken that have dealt with UX design, so I had some intrigue with this course. Usability testing can also be applied to several job fields where many different products need tested, so I recognize the importance of learning and research of this subject.</h2>
